# Flappy-Bird


# Description
This is a simple flappy bird game using Python and elements of pygame. The user uses the spacebar to flap the bird and manouver through the pipes. The objective of the game is to flap through as many pipes as possible without hitting any. 

# Features
Simple gameplay with intuitive controls.

# Installation
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Melakoo/Flappy-Bird
I ran it in pycharm and should work with Python 3.X and must have pygame installed through pip.

# Contributions
Wanted to give credit to origignal creators of flappy bird, DOTGEARS. at this project used quite a few images off of google images, a few were edited in photoshop so they could be used as assets for the game. Whatever I got from online is likely based off if not direcly from the orginal mobile game so it wouldn't make much sense to put a legal license on this.
